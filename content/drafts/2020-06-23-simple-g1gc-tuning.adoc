=== Default GC depends on "server class"

If your application is running with less than 2 cpus or less than 2gb of 
memory the JVM heuristics think the app is not running on a server, which makes 
the SerialGC the default GC, while this is unlikely to be an issue with apps that 
use less than 2GB of heap. It may well be an issue for apps that don’t use much 
CPU but require more memory. In this case it might be useful to toggle UseG1GC.

This heuristic probably predates containers and cgroups hype, and doesn't look 
like it has been updated to reflect this trend.

Anyway it’s always possible to guide the JVM heuristics on this matter, using 
`-XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine` (which let’s the default GC be used), or 
by enabling a particular GC algorithm.

ZGC has load barrier (inserted by the JIT at strategic places)
this barrier checks has a bad _color_, and fix the object reference.

Currently, ZGC time pause time increase with more threads (GC roots),
because this phase is not concurrent. However, work has begun in
https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/376[JEP 376], which shows great progress
so far ith sub-millisecond pauses.
