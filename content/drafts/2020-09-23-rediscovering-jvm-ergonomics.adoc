summary: Running your production in containers will help you redicover the JVM ergonomics.

:y: ✔
:n: ✖︎



Ergonomics tunes internal JVM values, such as thread pool sizes used by the GC.
They may even choose a GC algorithm for you.

*Ergonomics* for servers was first introduced in
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/ergonomics5.html[Java SE 5.0].

Ergonomics greatly reduced time spent on tuning _server_ applications -- at the
time the JVM had two mode _client_ and _server_ -- in particular heap
sizing and other _advanced_ GC flag tuning. But other components were affected
like the compiler threads.

Since the Java 7, the _client_ mode is inactive on a 64 bit JDK

> `-client`
> Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM. A 64-bit capable JDK currently ignores
> this option and instead uses the Java Hotspot Server VM.

which should effectively eliminate the two modes `-client` and `-server`. However
the concept behind server-class still remains and actually may cause you some
surprises.

In the next section I'll take a look at the following items

* GC threads
* GC region sizes // TODO Maybe not, the region sizes as this is usually modified by Xms/Xmx
* HotSpot compilation thread count
* Code cache sizes
* `ForkJoinPool` (and incidentally `CompletableFuture`)

//For the CPU, before the container support that landed in JDK10, the JVM used a
//https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/1549539c00c2b348882b1aca7a65eb97174d6b7c/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#L365[`sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF))` call]
//to get the number of processors. With container support, the JVM process look
//up the relavant `cpu.shares` and `cpu.quota` files to get an _estimation of the active processors_.

Unless specified on the command line via `ActiveProcessorCount` the
https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/1549539c00c2b348882b1aca7a65eb97174d6b7c/src/hotspot/share/runtime/os.hpp#L149[`os::initialize_initial_active_processor_count()`]
https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/1549539c00c2b348882b1aca7a65eb97174d6b7c/src/hotspot/os/linux/os_linux.cpp#L5490-L5522[method on Linux]
will use either a syscall to get the number of processors, or get the value from the cgroup's
relevant `cpu.shares` and `cpu.quota` files (see
https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/1007c9c1f46644d325bb4d4bd3a3d6dc718c713e/src/hotspot/os/linux/osContainer_linux.cpp#L568-L655[`OSContainer::active_processor_count()`]).


TIP: Using the flag `-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal` to see these default values is immediately
useful. And a live application one can use `jcmd $(pidof java) VM.flags -all`.


== GC

The https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/ergonomics.html[JDK 11 GC tuning and ergonomics]
page mentions these points :

 * _Garbage-First (G1) collector,_ <= Actually that's not always the default GC,
there's always the _server-class_ mechanism in place.
 * _The maximum number of GC threads is limited by heap size and available CPU resources_ <=
CPU counts indeed but the size of the heap isn't, it's the available memory.
 * _Initial heap size of 1/64 of physical memory_ <= {y}
 * _Maximum heap size of 1/4 of physical memory_ <= {y}

This section will focus on the worker thread ergonomics, heaping sizing, heap
spaces (eden, survivor, old), regions are other ergonomics that this article
won't dive into.

Let's take a simple look at GC threads:

.On the OS

<1> On this machine G1GC has been chosen ergonomically
<2> `ConcGCThreads` is configured ergonomically
<3> `ParallelGCThreads` appears to be the default, but as we'll see the default
value is chosen as a function of the available processors

The math of these flags is different for each GC and could change on new JDK release.

For G1GC `ParallelGCThreads` and `ConcGCThreads`
this http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/g1gc-1984535.html[Oracle Tech Network article]
(by https://twitter.com/mon_beck[Monica Beckwith]) mentions (emphasis are mine)

> The value of n is the same as the number of logical processors up to a value of 8.
> If there are more than eight logical processors, sets the value of n to approximately *5/8 of the logical processors*.

> Sets n to approximately *1/4 of the number of parallel garbage collection threads* (`ParallelGCThreads`).


Let's play with docker to show these values _in action_ within a constrained _cgroup_ (note the use of `--cpus` which
sets a _cpu-quota_ for a `cpu-period`).

<1> CPU is less than 1, which sets `SerialGC` as the default GC because the JVM
assumes there's at most one hardware thread
<2> Consequently there's no need for GC threads
<3> If they are more than 1 CPU, G1GC is chosen as the default this time
<4> If there's less than 2 CPU and less than 2 GiB, `SerialGC` is again the default
<5> If there's more than 2 CPU and less than 2 GiB, then it is G1GC


CAUTION: If the application is running with fewer than `2 cpus` and less than `1792 GiB`
of memory the JVM heuristics _think_ the app is not running on a server which makes
the `SerialGC` the default GC.

Running the `SerialGC` may not be an issue for some workload, but it can be one
on others. In this case it might be useful to toggle the GC explicitly.

Let's look at the source to get a precise picture of what's going on.

Inspecting the source code it is possible to guide the JVM heuristics on this matter :

* Use `-XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine` which consequently let the _server_ GC be used,
* Enable a GC algorithm explicitly
* Use `-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=<number>`, but memory

In my opinion enabling a particular GC algorithm is the superior choice has it is
explicit, in regard of the GC parameters.


Now let's focus on the worker threads for the different GCs. The table below
summarize the worker threads for GCs you can find in the JDK (starting from JDK11u).

_ZGC is experimental from JDK 11 to JDK 15 excluded and as such require
to unlock experimental options to be used._

[cols="2,3a"]
|===
| Garbage Collector |  Worker threads options

| *Serial* | non-applicable of course

| *Parallel* |
* `ParallelGCThreads`

| *CMS* |
* `ParallelGCThreads`
* `ConcGCThreads`

| *G1* |
* `ParallelGCThreads`
* `ConcGCThreads`
* `G1ConcRefinementThreads`

| *Shenandoah* |
* `ParallelGCThreads`
* `ConcGCThreads`

| *ZGC* |
* `ParallelGCThreads`
* `ConcGCThreads`

|===

In general one can say that

. The _parallel threads_  are threads that will perform work when the world is paused
. The _concurrent threads_ are threads that will perform work concurrently with the application


The GC thread count is based on the number of processors reported by the system
and differ for each GC. In the subsequent sections I'll have an overlook for
G1, Shenandoah and ZGC. I will skip Parallel and CMS GC as G1 is now default
since JDK 11 but the rationale is the same.

In order tweak those we need to understand what they are supposed to do, and to
understand what they are supposed to do it is essential to have a basic understanding
of how the GC work.

NOTE: I will use the term `ncpus` as the _active processor count_.

|===

NOTE: The source code indicates the `ParallelGCThreads` for G1GC (and CMS) is not
defined as being set ergonomically (`FLAG_SET_DEFAULT`), but in my opinion this
flag is somewhat _ergonomic_ in its nature.

To understand exactly what these ergonomics affect, it's possible to rely on the
official G1GC documentation, in particular there is https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/gctuning/garbage-first-garbage-collector.html#GUID-F1BE86FA-3EDC-4D4F-BDB4-4B044AD83180[this schema]
that tries to picture G1 collections cycle. Otherwise, there's this great
https://plumbr.io/handbook/garbage-collection-algorithms-implementations#g1[documentation]
by the people of https://plumber.io[plumber.io].

.G1 Collection Cycle Overview
image::/assets/rediscovering-jvm-ergonomics/g1-cycle.png

TIP: blue dots are young collections, young evacuation pauses happens there,
orange dots are remark and cleanup pauses respectively, red dots are part of
the space reclamation phase (mixed collections, full gc)


`ParallelGCThreads`::
These threads are employed during stoop-the-world pauses, they are in particular
doing the following job:

* *Evacuation* : This pause moves live objects to another region, the reference
of moved objects will need to be updated.
* *Remark* : This is a pause that finalizes the concurrent marking (of live objects)
itself, additionally this pause may be an opportunity to unload classes.
* *Cleanup* : This pause is a step where G1GC determines whether a space-reclamation
phase need to follow. Also, the cleanup phase is when G1GC can collect dead humongous
objects. Finally, if G1GC deems space-reclamation necessary, ie collect old regions,
this phase will prepare for a _mixed young collection_.

`ConcGCThreads`::
In the original design of G1GC, the marking of live objects is performed concurrently,
so the main job is:

* *Marking* : Marking live objects is also used to determine the liveness of regions.

`G1ConcRefinementThreads`::
This a specific G1 pool of threads that work concurrently and updates remembered-sets.
For reference _remembered-sets_ (aka _RSets_) are per-region entries that are
used by G1 GC to track inbound object references into a heap region.
The RSets avoid scanning the whole heap to track references, this is particularly helpful
to keep evacuation pauses "reasonably" short as G1 just needs to scan the region's RSet.
+
The RSet is in fact a buffer that log object updates. It is expected is that
this entry is processed by the refinement threads only. However, if there are
too many updates or too many cross-region references, the refinement threads may
not keep up, and the application threads will take over.


NOTE: Personally I never had to tweak the concurrent marking of G1 (`ConcGCThreads`)
or the RSets (`G1ConcRefinementThread`), with containers however I really had to
tweak the stop-the-world worker (`ParallelGCThreads`).

The JVM has a lot of flags here and there that can be used to alter the default
*ergonomics*, e.g. `UseDynamicNumberOfGCThreads`, if you use them you enter the
tuning terrain!




=== Shenandoah

Shenandoah is a _next_generation_ low-pause collector, and like all GCs in OpenJDK
it defines a pool of threads for certain tasks

|===
| Pool | Controlled by | Default

| **Concurrent GC Threads**
.2+| `-XX:ConcGCThreads`
.2+| stem:[max(1, "ncpus" / 4)]

source: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk11u/blob/1549539c00c2b348882b1aca7a65eb97174d6b7c/src/hotspot/share/gc/shenandoah/shenandoahArguments.cpp#L70-L72[shenandoahArguments.cpp]

| This where most of the work is done, from updating references to moving objects

| **Parallel GC Threads**
.2+| `-XX:ParallelGCThreads`
.2+| stem:[max(1, "ncpus" / 2)]

  // Set up default number of parallel threads. We want to have decent pauses performance
  // which would use parallel threads, but we also do not want to do too many threads
  // that will overwhelm the OS scheduler. Using 1/2 of available threads seems to be a fair
  // compromise here. Due to implementation constraints, it should not be lower than
  // the number of concurrent threads.
  bool ergo_parallel = FLAG_IS_DEFAULT(ParallelGCThreads);
  if (ergo_parallel) {
    FLAG_SET_DEFAULT(ParallelGCThreads, MAX2(1, os::initial_active_processor_count() / 2));
  }

| If the concurrent GC didn't keep up there's an _allocation failure_, in which
case Shenandoah starts a _degenerated gc_.

|===

NOTE: The source code indicates these two pool of threads are not marked as
being set ergonomically (`FLAG_SET_DEFAULT`), but in my opinion these flags are
somewhat _ergonomic_ in their definition.

== End words

In the code source it should be easy to find ergonomic flags as they are usually
prefixed by `FLAG_SET_ERGO`, but it happens that GC authors have chosen to use
`FLAG_SET_DEFAULT` instead for reason I have not yet investigated.
