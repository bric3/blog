Alternatives to monitor a folder.

== facebook/watchman


A possible alternative to look at [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman).
This tool is a native process with Java bindings

> Watchman is known to compile and pass its test suite on:
>
> * Linux systems with `inotify`
> * macOS (uses `FSEvents` on 10.7+, `kqueue(2)` on earlier versions)
> * Windows x64 on Windows 7, Windows Server 2012 R2 and later is currently in **beta** status.




Their https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install[install procedure] is currently a bit messy
in my opinion, it's hard to actually find an exact version for linux. You currently have to search through
the https://github.com/facebook/watchman/actions?query=is%3Asuccess+event%3Apush+workflow%3ACI[Github Actions jobs]
and search for an artifact with a positive size (around 8Â MB).

> The following artifacts have expired and are no longer able to be downloaded.


CAUTION: `watchman` does not follow semantic versioning! (https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/compatibility[Source])

This tool is native however it does have several language bindings, C++ and NodeJS are the one that are documented.
However the source code shows additional languages including https://github.com/facebook/watchman/tree/master/java[Java].

Usage of this code is not documented at this time. But by looking at the code,
the Java client (and probalby in other languages as well) uses Unix domain socket (named pipe)
and Windows Pipes to communicate with the `watchman` process. Like Docker, with Java Client
example https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java[there].

.Java API usage
[source,java]
----
// Identifiy the actual socket depending on the platform
WatchmanTransport socket = WatchmanTransportBuilder.discoverTransport(1, SECOND);

WatchmanClient client = new WatchmanClientImpl(WatchmanTransportBuilder.discoverTransport());
client.start();
ListenableFuture<SubscriptionDescriptor> sd = client.subscribe(Paths.get("/etc"), null, new Callback() { // <1>
      @Override
      public void call(Map<String, Object> event) {
        // act on event
      }
    });

// unsubscribe
client.unsbscribe(sd.get());

client.close();
----
<1> Use the same semantic as the https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/subscribe[`subscribe`] command internally.

The `WatchmanClient` exposes almost the same API as the `watchman` cli tool.
